    <p>
        ZBT Delta Lambda is a proud member of the Greek Life of Monmouth College in Monmouth, IL. We are an organization that strives
        to best exemplify our core values such as brotherhood and service. While we have lived in a variety of locations
        throughout our time at the college, we are currently housed in the B Wing of the college's fraternity complex: on
        the corner of 9th Street and Euclid Avenue. A small but mighty chapter of just over 20 members, ZBT Delta Lamba is
        known on campus to house The Best Boys in Town, and have always made apparent the difference between a "frat" and
        a "fraternity."

    <p>
        Children's Miracle Network Hospitals has been ZBT's national charity since 2002. All of our philanthropy
        events benefit the organization, with our biggest events being Get on The Ball and our annual Pancake Dinner.
    </p>


    <h3> Get on the Ball! </h3>

    <p>
        Once or twice a year, Delta Lambda hosts the Get on the Ball event where
        we roll a giant beach ball around campus. Students, faculty, and campus organizations can donate to the CMN and sign
        their name on the ball.
    </p>

    <h3> Pancake Dinner </h3>

    <p>
        Every spring, ZBT Delta Lamda hosts its annual Pancake Dinner. The event started in 2013
        when a brother needed help raising funds for his mother's cancer treatment. Since her unfortunate passing,
        we remember her by hosting the event every year in memory of Michelle Forrester. The event now
        serves to raise funds for the American Cancer Society through donations, food, and raffles.
